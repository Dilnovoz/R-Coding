```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. You should not include the lecture notes, but put exercises in a new file. (1 point loss if all included)
2. You should do the Vienna exercises
3. Class exercises were not mandatory (this could have been clearer)
4. Long lines of code do not appear properly in the output, so you should attempt to break them up so they are visible in the pdf (not worth a 1 point loss by itself, unless repeated and annoying)
5. Report errors in a replicable way
