# TODOS

**Note:** Automatic testing of assignments offline seems unhelpful. Generating pdfs (or htmls) and assessing each other seems more promising. In short, stick to the method I had 2 years ago, but make it easier in the first week so it does not require pdf submissions.

## Content

- Start functions in week 1 and keep building on them
- Less visualization?

## Assignments

1. Teach them pdf generation in week 1 in a separate session -- that should be most of the assignment for week 1.
2. After that, they can upload their answers/pdfs to be graded by others
3. Shorten assignments from before substantially with less emphasis on presentation, since they have less time between classes to work
4. Have the online quizzes instead
   - including parameterized problems
   - live quiz (via congame) for full credit on participation, irrespective of score on it. Part should be without googling, only R help, part with. Part with running code, part without. If they don't know the answer to a question, have to say what they tried, why they are stuck, or else doesn't count as participation.
5. Ask weekly surveys and belief question, ask them to do data analysis on that
6. Weekly report on errors and issues, insights and epiphanies. Write up errors that you hit during the week

## Extra sessions

- Plan a git session before first class
- Plan a git session (OH) in first week
- Plan a tinytex pdf session in week 2

## Exercises

- Start making commits for homework with meaningful messages
- Create fork of repo in week 2
    - How to fork the original repo: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
    - learn how to keep it in sync with upstream
    - 4 pull requests, learn how to make pull requests
- Create and resolve issues

## Future

Have a way to connect to the DB to check whether the functions (called `exercise1_week1`) works as expected for new use cases.
